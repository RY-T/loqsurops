Basically, the files numbered based on their order in the sequential mapping. These 4 files each contain the coordinates required for each of the 4 citation siRNA indexes. 

#01
this is an excel file containing coordinates of identified cis-nat loci. Only the first 117 rows/features were identified as 
cis-nat loci WHICH ALSO generate siRNA. So only take the first 117 feature rows. 

#02
In this study they did IP on AGO2, a protein that is known to associate with siRNAs. They then obtained the RNA from IP-ed samples 
and performed sequencing, basically instead of chIP-seq its rIP-seq, RNA in this case. 

So they generally did 2 sample, in basic drosophila S2 cells and drosophila overian cells. 
The siRNA list generated from both libraries are on page 8 and 9 respectively.
Its quite obvious that there are overlaps between both libraries, but i think we just create both separately first
then see how. 
The coordinates can be found on pg 8 and 9 


#03
Similar methodology as #2, but this time conducted by Okamura. Its also a AGO2-rIP.
The coordinates can be found on pg 23-24


#04
Total siRNA seq from S2 cells, this one mainly identifies transposable elements and some cis-nat sequences.
The coordinates can be found on pg 21-25
